== Mercurial Easymerge
-- Author: Sébastien Pierre <sebastien@xprima.com>
-- Version 0.9.0

The [Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial) version control system has a
default method of merging conflicts that has some limitations:

 - Conflicts must be resolved by the user in an arbitrary order
 - It is not possible to resolve a conflict in multiple, interrupted steps
 - It is not easy to get access to the different revisions in conflict

The purpose of the Mercurial _Easymerge_ tool is simply to help developers
resolve conflicts that may occur within a merge :

 - Conflicts are attributed a number, and can be resolved in any order
 - Conflict resolution can be undone if necessary
 - Resolution process can be stopped and resumed at will
 - All available revisions for a conflict are made available on the filesystem

_Easymerge_ is available as a `hg-easymerge` command line utility, which has to be
installed by adding the following line in your `~/.hgrc`:

>	merge = hg-easymerge

This enables _Easymerge_ to be invoked whenever you use the `hg merge` command.

Usage
=====

Easymerge is automatically started when you do a `merge` with Mercurial. It will
automatically populate your working directory with `.current`, `.other` and
`.original` versions of each file where there is a conflict. You should not edit
these files
