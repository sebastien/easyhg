== XPrima Mercurial Extensions
-- Author: Sébastien Pierre <sebastien@xprima.com>
-- Version: 1.0

[Mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial) is an easy to use, versatile,
distributed revision control system written in the Python language. The
distributed nature of Mercurial makes it well-suited for open source
development, but sometimes less easy than other RCS when used in a centralized
style.

The setup we use at XPrima is as follows:

 - All projects are hosted on a single Linux file server, accessible through
   Samba and SSH.
 - Developers have their workspace on the same file server.
 - Developers work either on Win32 or Linux.

In particular:

 - We have a `Projects` directory with all projects (in development or retired)
 - We have a `Home` directory with all developer workspaces (where projects are
   checked out).

The purpose of the _XPrima Mercurial Extensions_ is to fulfill the following
requirements :

 - Add the notion of _central_ and _developer_ repositories
 - Add per-project meta-information such as description and list of developers
 - Allow per-project locking of files or directories
 - Provide tools to ease the resolution of conflicts (when merging)
 - Provide tools to ensure rich, structured commits
 - Provide tools to give developers and managers an overview of the development
   process

In this respect, we offer the following tools:

 - _Easymerge_, which makes merging easier by providing additional
   functionalities
 - _Easycommit_, which eases the writing of richer commit messages
 - _Project_, which adds per-project meta-information and the ability to define
   central and "development" repositories.
