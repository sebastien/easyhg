Introduction
============

Mercurial can be used in a _centralized_ style, where there is a single location
for the "main" (central) project repositories, and where each individual
developer maintain its changes in a local repository, where it pushes and pull
to the central repository.

>                         <----------- clone ----------- 
>    [WORKING REPOSITORY] <----------- pull  ----------- [CENTRAL REPOSITORY]
>          (many)         ------------ push  ---------->        (one)

In this case, it is useful to explicitly create a link between the working
repository and the central repository, and to provide tools to easily check the
state between both.

Features
========

The Mercurial project extension adds support for describing projects in such
environments:

  - A project can be named and described
  - A project has a number of owners, responsible for the central repository,
    and a number of developers, having their own "branches"
  - A working repository for a project inherits the information from the central
    repository it is bound to.

The main purpose of the project extension is to have an easy summary of the
project status:

>	hg project
>	Name        : GuestPW (working)
>	Description : Time-based Apache 1.3 authentication module
>	Path        : /home/sebastien/Workspace/GuestPassword
>	Parent      : /home/sebastien/Network/Home/Projects/guestpw
>	Owner       : sebastien@xprima.com
>	Developer   : sebastien@xprima.com

Gives you information on the current project, whether you are in the working or
central repository, and additional tells you if your repository is :

   - _out of sync_, which means the central repository has changes you do not
     have in the working repository.
   - _modified_, which means that the working repository has changes that could
     be pushed to the central repository
